	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld()
	bob = Turtle()
	wait_for_user()

Suppose you wrote a function, center_circle(), that draws a circle of a given radius around the current location of the turtle and restores the turtle to its starting point.

-- What turtle functions would you use to move the turtle from the center to the edge of the circle and get ready to call the original circle() function?
Answer: 
pu(bob)
bk(bob, r)
pd(bob)


-- Suppose the interface of this function requires the turtle to end up in the same place it started, facing in the same direction it started.
Answer:
pu(bob)
bk(bob, r)
rt)bob)
pd(bob)
-- What is this type of requirement called?
Answer: precondition and postcondition
